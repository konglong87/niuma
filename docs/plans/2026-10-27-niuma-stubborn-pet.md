# Niuma A — stubborn companion delivery

## Scope and architecture

Approved direction: A, large cream muzzle, carved nostrils, half-lidded eyes,
asymmetric horse ears, swept forelock, squat orange body and dark hooves.
Implement real local GLB geometry, not a billboard or the AI concept image.
Reuse the shared Blender pipeline, existing four named motion joints and asset
registry. Keep `niuma` as default; preserve the previous Niuma bytes as
`niuma-classic`. Go Companion / Chinese Dragon remain unchanged. No credentials,
provider changes, model calls, new dependencies, branches or release publishing.

Initial worktree: clean, HEAD 4955ec6; pulled origin/main before changes.

## Ordered implementation ledger

1. Verified: reproducible sculpt + transparent poster; visual review at large
   and desktop sizes. Files: scripts/assets/build_niuma.py, sculpt helpers,
   web/public/assets/pets/niuma.{glb,png}, niuma-classic.{glb,png}.
2. Verified: asset registry / focused regression tests; validate classic choices,
   GLB geometry, rig origins, resource budget, fallback poster, motion / focus.
3. Verified: full frontend tests + typecheck; build and sign local Wails app;
   actual native clicks, all four model choices, saved default after restart.
4. Next: real native screenshot for README; update brand/personalization copy,
   review diff, commit each verified slice and push origin/main.

Acceptance: inspect actual model renders and actual native screenshots, not only
DOM assertions. Browser scripted acceptance supplements native acceptance.
Autonomous model task execution is not relevant to a character-only change.
Concept-to-model likeness is an artistic approximation, not pixel equivalence.
Signing/notarization distribution and new releases are deferred.

## Evidence / delivery

Evidence directory: desktop-v2/build/validation/20261027/niuma-stubborn/ (ignored).
Tests, visual review, commits and push results to be recorded after execution.

## Implementation acceptance — 2026-10-27

- Blender 5.2.2 rebuilt the model + transparent 336×396 poster; the ignored
  1000×1000 render was reviewed separately from the native screenshot.
- 579,536-byte GLB, 41 meshes / 27,172 triangles, no external images/textures;
  intentional 768 KiB asset cap accommodates carved/smoothed nose geometry.
- Old Niuma (Classic), Go Companion and Dragon: all six GLB/PNG byte hashes
  match baseline 4955ec6. Both original non-Niuma assets are untouched.
- Focused tests: 3 suites / 11 tests; full frontend: 82 suites / 807 tests;
  typecheck and focused lint pass. Browser E2E: 6 cases on desktop/narrow/mobile,
  including four model choices, moving WebGL frames, focus freeze and drag/hide.
- Native Wails: all four models visibly rendered via real settings clicks;
  save/readback and quit/relaunch preserve Niuma. Preview scale adjusted locally
  from 1 to 1.25 for inspection; shipped default scale remains 1.
- Local build/signature pass using installed Go 1.26.0 with process-scoped
  PATH/GOTOOLCHAIN=local. Default launcher failed because host GOSUMDB is off;
  no global Go configuration or security setting changed.
- No backend code changed, so no new backend test run is claimed. No autonomous
  model calls, live task success, Windows native run or notarization claimed.

Remaining: replace README desktop screenshot with actual restarted native capture,
finish documentation review and publish the documentation slice. Final commit/push
results recorded in the ignored evidence EVIDENCE.md and delivery response.
